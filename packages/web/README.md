# Capitals of the world

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This static website shows capital cities and countries information based on data returned by an API endpoint.

## Getting Started

Install modules with Yarn:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Run the development server. Default API endpoint is `localhost:4000`, you can change with the `API_URL` environment variable

```bash
$ export API_URL=https://countries.trevorblades.com/
$ yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.


## Build static site

```bash
$ export API_URL=https://countries.trevorblades.com/
$ yarn build
```
